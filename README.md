# qbittorrent-manager
qBittorrent Queue Manager is a Python script that automates the management of your torrent queue based on download speed. It monitors active torrents and moves slow torrents to the bottom of the queue after a defined period of slow speed. The script is designed to run inside a Docker container, making it easy to deploy and configure.
